# Thank you for checking out my portfolio page!

The UX of this page is based on GSAP Scrolltrigger, used both to control progress through the wormhole and to display and hide the content cards. The wormhole itself is made using three.js and was adapted from a codepen by Aaron Sherrill available here: https://codepen.io/motionharvest/pen/WNQYJyM
