Morse Code Translator (Wed 23rd)
Build a website that allows users to input english or morse, and convert to morse or english
Can be submit based, or can be dynamic based on user input
spaces to delimit character, 4 spaces for word delimiter
[a-z ], but you can support more things
Example:
let obj = {
    a: "..",
    b: "...",
    ....
}



PLANNING BY ME

take in a string of words delimited by spaces
"hello how are you"

split the string into an array of strings
["hello", "how", "are", "you"]

take each word and split it into an array of letters
["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

take each letter and push its equivalent code into the morseArray, followed by a spaces

after each word is translated, push four spaces into the morseAreay



make sure morse code box will only accept dot, dash and space characters
make sure letter box will only accept A-Z, a-z, comma, stop and space characters
make an error appear if an unsupported character is put in
